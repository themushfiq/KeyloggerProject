# KeyloggerProject

ABSTRACT
This is a surveillance application used to track the users which logs keystrokes; and uses log 
files to retrieve information. Using this application we can recall forgotten emails or URLs. 
In this keylogger project, whenever the user types something through the keyboard, the 
keystrokes are captured and mailed to the mail ID of the admin without the knowledge of the 
user within the time set.

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this application is to keep track of every key that is typed through the 
keyboard and send it to the admin through the mail server in the time set or given. It 
provides confidentiality as well as data recovery to all the IT infrastructures in need. 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
Operating system: Windows and Linux specified
RAM: 512MB (minimum requirement) 
Hard Disk: 1GB working space (minimum requirement)

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
Languages: Python 
Tools: PyCharm, Python 3.8.0 
Technology: Advanced programming using Python

Purpose 
The main objective of this document is to illustrate the requirements of the project 
Keylogger. Nowadays IT business infrastructures are mostly in need of the cyber security 
factor that is Computer Forensics. Keyloggers can effectively assist a computer forensics 
analyst in the examination of digital media.
Keystroke loggers are available in software and hardware form and are used to capture 
and compile a record of all typed keys. The information gathered from a keystroke logger 
can be saved on the system as a hidden file, or emailed to the forensic analyst or the 
Administrator. Generic keystroke loggers typically record the keystrokes associated with 
the keyboard typing. Advanced keystroke loggers have many additional features. Our 
project keylogger has the following features; 
• Monitors Keystrokes 
• Sends mail to the Admin’s mail ID 
• Logs keystrokes including special keys

Project Function: 
Authorized use of a keylogger is the use of such software with the knowledge and consent of the PC 
Owner or security administrator. As a rule, authorized monitoring software products require 
physical access to a computer and administrative privilege for configuration and installation that 
excludes (or at least minimizes) risks of unauthorized use of programs. As per the rule, such 
software products can obtain and configure a “packed” installation executable file that 
is delivered to the user’s computer with the help of various ethical and authorized schemes. 
During installation, it doesn’t display any messages or create any windows on the screen.

Features: 
Features of designed keylogger that are implemented and are going to be implemented in 
this project; 
• Keystroke Recording 
• Remote Monitoring 
• Web History logging 
• Screenshot History 
• Invisible mode & password protection 
• Application monitoring and file tracking 
• Email reports

Conclusion and Future Work: 
A Keylogger is a form of software that is used to track or log all the keys 
that a user strikes on their keyboard, usually in secret so that the user of the system 
doesn’t know that their actions are being monitored. It is otherwise known as 
a keyboard capturer. These are perfectly legal and useful. They can be installed by 
employers to oversee the use of their computers, meaning that the employees have 
to complete their tasks instead of procrastinating on social media. Some of the 
possible amendments and improvements in this project are; 
• Adding screenshots of pages visited.
• Recording of the system screen.
• Full remote cloud monitoring.
• Screenshot of immediately changed pages.
• Secure web account for data storing.
• Password Protection.
